## Development

### Installing Dependencies

We don't want you to go through the laundry list of dependencies manually. Just let Gulp install all dependencies for you. If you feel uncomfortable delegating this job to Gulp, check the gulpfile.js file to see what it will install for you.

```sh
npm install -g gulp # sudo, if appropriate
gulp install # from the project root directory
```
